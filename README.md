# Microsoft Office 2007 Sounds Installer  
This is the official installer for accessibility sound effects in Office 2007, which is no longer available on Microsoft's website. **Note:** I do not own the rights to this file—the installer is copyrighted by Microsoft.  

## Installation  
1. Open Word, Excel or PowerPoint 2007.  
2. Click the **Office button** in the top-left corner, then select **"_____ Settings"** (replace the blank with the name of the program you opened).  
3. Navigate to **Advanced > General** and check the option **"Provide feedback with sound."**  
4. A prompt will appear, directing you to Microsoft's website. Confirm the prompt, then close the browser once it opens (the webpage is no longer available).  
5. Close all Office programs.  
6. Download `Sounds.EXE` from one of these sources:  
   - [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20070320010602if_/http://download.microsoft.com:80/download/OfficeXPStandard/sounds/1/W98NT42KMe/EN-US/Sounds.EXE)  
   - This repository  
   - [My website](https://www.felixan.ca/direct/Sounds.EXE) (*works in the Chinese mainland*)  
7. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.  
8. Reopen your Office applications—sound effects (e.g., for saving, undoing) should now be audible.
